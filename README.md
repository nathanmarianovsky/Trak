<h1 align="center">Trak</h1>

Trak is the one-stop application designed for cataloging all content read and watched. In order to install for use simply download the package for your operating system in the releases.


## Why?

This application was motivated by the simple thought that there is no such dedicated app out there. A typical user will find themselves creating a sheet in order to keep track of content read and/or watched, but this is not visually appealing and can become cumbersome depending on the size of the library. On the other hand using a website solves this, but depends upon a platform that can be offline all the while pushing advertisements on the user. While there are many features that can be motivated from a website service this application maintains all data locally. 


## Future Features

The following is a list of features that are in the plans for future releases:
* Application Logo
* Addition/Removal/Update of Book, Film, Manga, and Show Records
* Addition/Removal/Update of Record Associations
	* A record association is meant to link two or more items across multiple categories. In example, an anime can typically be associated to light novels and manga. 
* Update the index page search bar.
	* Currently the search bar searches only by name. It would be nice to have a search bar that can perform a search based on other details associated to a record.
	* Implement a search bar that searches through online libraries for existing records. Most likely each category will have their own libraries to search through.
* Design a notification system that can update the user on any record that has an upcoming release date.
